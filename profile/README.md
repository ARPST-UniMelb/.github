# AR-PST - UniMelb

This organisation collects all open-source developments that have been developed by the research team at The University of Melbourne (UniMelb) 
as part of the work for [AR-PST initiative](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/energy/Electricity-transition/AR-PST/), 
under the leadership of CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).


## Overview
Four core repositories are developed:
1. **[PISP.jl](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/PISP.jl)**: A data parser to parse public ISP data into the required format.
2. **[PRASNEM.jl](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/PRASNEM.jl)**:
An adequacy framework to enable high-speed, NEM-wide time-sequential operational runs accounting for random unplanned outages using [PRAS](https://github.com/NREL/PRAS).
3. **[SiennaNEM.jl](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/SiennaNEM.jl)**: An operability framework for sequential and time-coupled modelling framework for operational assessments of the NEM using [Sienna](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna).
4. **[NEM-reliability-suite](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/NEM-reliability-suite)**: A collection of examples, studies and data to assess reliability of the NEM using the repositories.

## Getting started
**NEM-reliability-suite** compromises tutorial scripts and is able to call the packages, therefore, we recommend starting by following the tutorial in its [ReadMe](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/NEM-reliability-suite).
